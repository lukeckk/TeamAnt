      <p>Hi, my name is Andrew, or Andy. I am just starting  out in the BAS of Software Development, while working part
        time. I moved to Australia for one semester to attend university at Curtin University in Perth for a BAS in
        Computer Science. I ended up moving back early, because homesickness hit way harder than I expected it to. I
        enjoy working on my cars in my free time, although it's a love/hate thing.</p>

      <p>I am a third-year student in the BAS Software development program, previously I was 
        working as a Physical Therapist Assistant in Home Health and Skilled Nursing settings. 
        While it is a fun and rewarding job being able to help my patients to recover from injuries
        and become more independent with their own mobility while decreasing fall risk, but I 
        decided to make a career change after discoering the potentials and room for growth in the
        tech industry.
